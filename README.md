Analysis for wikimedia data


Our analysis focuses on analyzing a Wikimedia clicks dataset that tells you where users are navigating from and to, and the number of people in a given month that are going from one link to another.

The technical implementation of the project is that we:

  1. Data Engineering Set up a SQLite database for the english dump for a specific month (in this case December 2023â€™s english dataset). We'll make it scalable to accept other month's data and work on them as well.

  2. Sampling We sample the dataset to 10% to be able to easily process through pandas since we want to focus on the analysis. Our assumption is that 1% is representative of the database.

  3. Analysis: We analyze the link changes on wikipedia for December 2023 in English

    Scope: The dataset includes for December 2023, the total link transitions for the language english

    a. prev: The title of the Wikipedia article the user visited before the current one, or a special value indicating the source type (example 'other-search' may mean other search engines like Google, external of wikipedia).
    b. curr: The title of the current Wikipedia article the user visited.
    c. type: The type of referrer source. Possible values include:
    d. link: The user followed an internal link from another Wikipedia article.
    e. external: The user came from an external site (e.g., search engine).
    f. other: Other types of referrers.n: The number of occurrences of this (prev, curr, type) combination during the month.
